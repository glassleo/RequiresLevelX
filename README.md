# Requires Level X

In Patch 9.1, Blizzard removed the ability to see what level is required to equip or use an item in tooltips, if your character meets the requirement.

This is problematic in many situations, for example if you're trying to figure out if your alt could use a BoE that you found, or when you want to craft some gear for someone who is not max level.

This addon simply adds that functionality back.

## Options

You can easily Enable/Disable the addon via the in-game AddOns options panel.

By defualt the addon will only add "Requies Level..." to equippable items. There is an option to enable it for all items (such as consumables) if you want.

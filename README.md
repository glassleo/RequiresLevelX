# Requires Level X

In Patch 9.1, Blizzard removed the ability to see what level is required to equip or use an item if your character meets the requirement.

This is problematic in many situations, for example if you're trying to figure out if your alt could use a BoE that you found, or when you want to craft some gear for someone who is not max level.

This addon simply adds that functionality back into item tooltips.
